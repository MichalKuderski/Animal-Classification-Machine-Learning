# 🦁 Animal Classification: Machine Learning from Traits

## 📌 Project Overview
To build and evaluate supervised machine learning classification models (using scikit-learn) to accurately predict animal types based on various descriptive features and traits from a given dataset. This project demonstrates proficiency in building and tuning predictive models.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
* Language: Python
* Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Techniques: Supervised Classification (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees), Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-                    Score).

## 💡 Key Findings
* Model Performance: Built classification models that demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, confirming the correlation between physical traits and animal class.
* Feature Importance: Identified key categorical and numerical features that serve as the most significant predictors of animal class.
* Refinement: Improved model performance through iterative hyperparameter tuning and optimization techniques.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or install the libraries listed above).
3. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook animal_traits_classification.ipynb`
